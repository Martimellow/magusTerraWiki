Terrkanei is one of the 5 [World Trees](/magusTerraWiki/worldtrees/worldtrees/) in Magusterra. It is the only world tree that is not actually a tree, but is still considered a world tree due to it's significance in the world. 

# World Tree
Terrkanei is the [World Tree](/magusTerraWiki/worldtrees/worldtrees/) of Arcane, it is the root source of pure arcane magic in the world and thus it is a major location for any magically inclined individuals. 

# Infrastructure  
Even after the devastation from the [Dereliction of Terrkanei](/magusTerraWiki/zones/volariso/dereliction/) Terrkanei is still the primary center for magic user in Magusterra. The arcane is one of the most flexible magical systems in the world, it is far more abstract and not necessarily tied to specific movements or schools of magic and can take on many shapes depending on the caster, this makes Terrkanei a great attunement for mages in general. With its versatility and proximity the mages of Magusterra were not going to let a world shaking explosion prevent them from studying and so it took some time to rebuild the infrastructure around the iconic mountain but it is back in full swing. 

Terrkanei itself functions as a sort of university for the absolute most prestigious mages, many corridors, study rooms and dorms were cut into the mountain before The Dereliction these are still being used but to ensure the protection of the site all the entrances to the mountain itself have been physically sealed and are guarded by the **Sentinels of Terrkanei**. Leaving the only way into the world tree through teleportation. Now teleportation is a fickle spell it can be very draining too cast based on the distance traveled, amount of people teleporting, time the portal is open, proximity to magical source, familiarity with the destination and experience of the caster. Now as you might imagine this is why it is used as solution for the mages of Terrkanei. Only the most experienced mages, briefly teleport themselves a short distance at the literal source of arcane magic.  

## Interior 
Inside Terrkanei there is an expansive network of passageways wrapping all throughout the mountain, complete with quiet study rooms, reinforced experimentation rooms, large meeting rooms and even quaint dorms. There isn't much airflow in the sealed off mountains so a small amount of aspiring mages are thoroughly vetted and then employed doing the menial but highly sought after tasks of creating small portals throughout the inside of the mountain to various unknown locations around the world allowing fresh air and light in while letting smoke from hearths escape. They never keep these portals open in the same location for long to ensure the security of the interior of Terrkanei. There isn't much need for extra ambient light as the glow from the ley veins throughout the mountain illuminate the corridors and rooms, but specific task lighting is still useful for long sessions of studying scrolls.  

## Exterior 
Even non mages are aw struck by the beauty of Terrkanei. It sits a lonely mountain peak surrounded on three sides by long-grass prairies, the peaceful **Lake Kanei** laps against the northwest face of the mountain, wrapping around to the North and letting out to the **Imboivar Sea** to the east; and to the south are the breath taking **Floating Islands of Volariso** gently bobbing above the vast **Crater of Volariso**. If these stunning sights weren't enough the whole terrain breathes with a faint purple glow, the rock faces have veins of ley running all throughout them as if they were glued back together after the massive explosion and the grasslands and water shimmer with arcane energy.
