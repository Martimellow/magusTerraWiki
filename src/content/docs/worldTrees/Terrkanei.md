Terrkanei is one of the 5 **World Trees** in Magusterra. It is the only world tree that is not actually a tree, but is still considered a world tree due to it's significance in the world. 

# World Tree
Terrkanei is the **World Tree** of mana, it is the root source of magic in the world and thus it is a major location for any magicly inclined individuals. 

# Location
Terrkanei is found on the in the center of the **Western Blade** of MagusTerra just north of the **Floating Islands of Volariso**. From the north it can be seen as the lone mountain peak for miles giving off a faint purple glow from it's ley imbued rock. From the south it can only barely bee seen through the gaps in the Floating Island of Volariso. A river runs down the eastern side fo Terrkanei bringing it's mana rich runoff into the **Imboivar Sea**
