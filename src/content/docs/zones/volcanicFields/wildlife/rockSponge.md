title: Rock Sponge
---
A peculiar organism found in The Volcanic Fields  whose vital organs are hard as flint but exposed on the outside of its ribbed and porous body. The rock sponge almost feels fuzzy to the touch as there are thousands of near-imperceivable hairs on it which grab the toxic gasses out of the air to use as nutrients.
