These are the people who reside in [SeaCliff](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seacliff/), they are also known as SeaCliftons, Seacliffions, and Southies.

# Naming Traditions
## Family names
The Cliftons don't believe in family names, the emphasis of the society is on the community, not the individual family.

# Culture
## Customary Values
The primary value of the Cliftons is that in order for the society to survive every member must pull their weight, and if they don't then they can't be a part of the society. That mentality frames their entire way of thinking. If somebody isn't pulling their weight then society has no problem giving them a stern warning that they are at risk of being banished. If the behavior doesn't improve then society is very willing/accepting when it comes to banishing the individual to their almost inevitable death outside of society, even for family members. That being said this extreme case rarely happens because Clifton's understand that is the punishment for their actions. They are taught from a very young age the importance of the community. As well this mutual dependence on each other fosters a strong sense of respect as no one person can survive on their own and every individual contributes a necessary function to society.

## Common Dress Code
Most Cliftons were the same outfit as a result of the limited resources. Their clothes are made from the skin of a **Horwall**. The tailors of [SeaCliff](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seacliff/) take the skins of these animals, clean them thoroughly and then turn them inside out so the inner skin provides a waterproof outer layer while the warm fur insulates the inside. A typical outfit consists of a waterproof Hood Anorak, long pants, and wooden-soled moccasins that are wrapped in Horwall skins. There is also a variant of moccasin worn indoors that is only made of the skin of the Horwall for improved comfort when indoors.

# Ideals
## Gender Ideals
Cliftons value what an individual can do for society regardless of what gender they are. They are very practical people and don't lean towards specific gender roles.

## Courtship Ideals
When looking for a spouse a high level of significance is placed on work ethic and skill level. Society needs hard working skilled individuals to survive. Naturally, those that can provide this are thought more highly of and are more sought after. The practical nature of society takes precedence over physical appearance and even intellectual prowess.
 
That being said sexual intrigue is only natural. Pre-Union sex is neither uncommon nor frowned upon. The individuals in the society hold a great deal of respect for each other, they generally speaking don't try to take advantage of one another but recognize that they all have sexual needs and that sex is a natural part of life.

## Relationship Ideals
Generally, Union is between two Cliftons regardless of gender but there are no rules against polygamist relationships, that is up to the individuals. Both heterosexual and homosexual relationships are considered perfectly acceptable in society. When two individuals are United they commit themselves to each other for life. It is believed that the love between the two individuals improves morale and motivation to provide for society as a whole.
