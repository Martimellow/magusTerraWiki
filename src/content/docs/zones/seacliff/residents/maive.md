# Physical Description
## General Physical Condition
Maive is in superb physical condition as a result of the many years of training at the [Lunar Monks](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seaclifforganizations/lunarmonks/)  Academy. She can even enhance her physical beyond the normal human by channeling lunar energy into her body as a type of reservoir, giving her increased stamina and agility when she needs to call upon it.
## Identifying Characteristics
People can often tell it's Maive coming by her iconic unruly bun and almost luminescent blue eyes.

# Mental characteristics
# Education
Maive spent several years at the [Lunar Monk](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seaclifforganizations/lunarmonks/)  Academy learning the ways of the monks. She was left in the care of the monks at a young age when her parents were exiled from the community. This gave her an early start on her education helping her to be extra successful with her studies and even graduate early. However, this success was not without struggle. The long hours of focused studying and exhausting physical training would do a number on anyone. It is not easy to tune one's body to gather the energy about them and redirect it in a focused effort. But Maive's strong-willed nature and early indoctrination pulled her through it.
 
Those were very difficult years of rigid long schedules of getting up far before the sun came up and working late into the night. However, her strong will pulled her through that training until she was promoted to the rank of Artisan and eventually Master. She now works as an Invigorating Lunar Monk. Her main focus is on enhancing her stamina and mobility for long arduous journeys that are needed for the well-being of the community. This exciting lifestyle really feeds her wild nature. However, she is also a well-accomplished healer as all Master Invigorating Lunar Monks are.

# Employment
After Maive graduated from the [Lunar Monk](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seaclifforganizations/lunarmonks/) academy, earning the rank of Artisan Lunar Monk she started taking up an administrative role for the rare expeditions to the main world. Her early start at the academy helped her develop a strong aptitude for her trade, this coupled with her explorative nature made her a perfect fit for the expeditions. She loves to go to the main world and see what it has to offer her, the new sights, places, and cultures that she meets on each expedition inspire her and keep her wanting to come back for more.
 
This passion only fueled her in her studies wanting to reach the rank of Master so she could have more freedom to explore the cultures while she was out on the expeditions, so she would have to spend as much time tending to supplies and handling the minor injures and illnesses that an Artisan would busy themselves with. She now works as a Master Invigorative Lunar Monk during the expeditions. Her primary responsibility is to tend to any major injuries and severe illnesses that are slightly out of the skill level of the few Artisans on the expedition and to aid in any long-term travels or deliveries once the expedition reaches the main world.

# Mental Trauma
Maive inherited her wild nature from her parents, who were more free-spirited than the community allowed. They didn't agree with the system that governed [SeaCliff](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seacliff/) and often tried to push the limits on the commonly held standards of society. This resulted in a tenuous relationship between Maive's parents, the community, and the [Council of Elders](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seaclifforganizations/councilofelders/) . Eventually, this tension was at a breaking point, Maive's mother had neglected her duties one too many times and a trial was called. Her poor relationship with the rest of the town did her no favors and she was banished to the frozen wastes outside the town. Her father in hopes of saving his two loves, his wife and daughter, left Maive in the hands of his closest friend, Deric a [Master Lunar Monk](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seaclifforganizations/lunarmonks/) , to be raised as a Lunar Monk and set out to the frozen wasteland with his wife.
 
Maive hasn't heard from her parents since, she had no option but to accept their inevitable fates a long time ago. The Lunar Monk's training has kept her level-headed and understanding of the reason that the villagers acted as they did, understanding the importance of the community and how no exceptions can be made or else the entire community will fall to ruin. But understand as she does it is not so easy to let go of such trauma and Maive relishes any opportunity she has to leave SeaCliff on her expeditions to the main world. Not only does it get her away from the village that has never quite sat right with her, but it also allows her the opportunity to explore all the amazing possibilities the rest of the world holds, and secretly it holds a chance of stumbling upon her long lost parents.

# Intellectual Characteristics
Maive is a strong-willed and sometimes stubborn but ultimately level-headed individual. She grew up on the more young and wild side, but years of heavy discipline at the academy smoothed out her edges and taught her the power of serenity and how it can help a monk tap into the lunar energy coursing around them. Though certain situations are strong enough to pull her wild roots to the surface again.
