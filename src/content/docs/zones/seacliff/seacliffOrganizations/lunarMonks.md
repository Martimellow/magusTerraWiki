The Lunar Monks are some of the most noteworthy organizations of [SeaCliff](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seacliff/)  , through hundreds of years of study and observance of the two Moons that orbit MagusTerr the Lunar Monks have learned to harness some of the powers of the moons possess through a form of martial arts. By mimicking the fluid motion of the waves that are so prevalent on the shores of SeaCliff the Lunar Monks are allowed to channel the power of the Moons, using their bodies as a form of conduit that allows them to direct these powers.

# Structure

## Grand Master
As with all of the other trades in [SeaCliff](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seacliff/)  the highest ranking in the Lunar Monks is a Grand Master, there are only a few Grand Masters of the Lunar Monks who are the absolute masters of each of their specific specializations of the art form. Each of these Grand Masters has the opportunity to serve on the [Council of Elders](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seaclifforganizations/councilofelders/) if they so choose, at least one must, but not all are obligated to.
 
## Master
Below the Grand Masters are the Masters, these are all very well-respected veterans of their trade just simply not the best of the trade. There are many masters that see to the training and development of the lower-ranking members and of course pursue a deeper understanding of the magic they wield themselves. The responsibilities of the master rank are more varied and nuanced, many primarily focus on the education of younger monks, however, some have more adventurous and varied tasks that ultimately serve the community
 
## Artisan
Below the Masters are the Artisans, these Monks have still gone through years of training and are completely capable Lunar Monks they simply haven't reached the esteemed prestige of master yet. This rank of monks runs what little administrative layer there is of the organization. As [SeaCliff](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seacliff/) has no concept of money finances don't need to be balanced but there are certainly other administrative duties such as ensuring there are enough supplies for the order. These monks have passed the basic schooling level of Apprentice and are not considered skilled enough to teach new apprentices so they contribute to the organization by running these more mundane tasks that the others don't have time to do, while of course continuing their studies in hopes of becoming masters.
 
## Apprentice
Finally, the lowest level of Lunar Monks is an Apprentice. These are the students that attend the academy they don't have many responsibilities beyond studying and practicing their martial arts which can certainly be considered a full-time job.

# Abilities
The lunar monks channel the powers of the two moons that orbit MagusTerr, the Dull Moon and Vibrant Moon as the local [Cliftons](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/residents/cliftons/) refer to them as. The monks' powers strengthen and wane based on the proximity of the moon that they primarily draw upon, as well the moon that a lunar monk primarily draws upon determines some of the abilities that they can use. However, there are a few generic abilities that all monks have access to and whose strength is only modified slightly by the proximity of the monk's preferred moon. These abilities include:
 
## Generic Lunar Monk Abilities
Ability to manipulate water and waves
A form of telekinesis that allows the monk to pull objects to them
Lunar monks first learned how to harness the power of the moons by watching the tides and noticing how the tides were pushed and pulled by the moon. By mimicking the fluidity of the waves and surrendering themselves to the moons' power the monks were able to channel the moons' power allowing them to access the gravitational pull it possessed. They first practiced this on the water around them teaching them how to manipulate it just as the moons had. Gradually as more Grand Masters of the order experimented with their abilities they found that they were also able to extend the power of this gravitational pull to objects other than water giving them a form of telekinesis.
 
That being said the monks can only channel these powers through the use of fluid motions such as the wave. Almost as if they need to tap into the frequency of energy that the moon is transmitting to them. As a result, it is not as simple as lifting one's hand and drawing an object to you. It is an art form some might even call it a dance the fluid spins dips and extensions that are required to absorb the moons' energy and redirect it to the world around the monk. It can be very strenuous on the body and isn't always the most efficient method of achieving goals.

## Sects
There are two Primary Sects of Lunar Monks, with many potential variations that each monk is at liberty to pursue his or her self. The two primary sects are Invigorative Lunar Monks and Destructive Lunar Monks.
 
### Invigorative Lunar Monks
This sect of Lunar Monk primarily focuses on channeling the power of the Dull Moon to breathe life into their actions. Their powers are of course more potent when the Dull moon is closer to MagusTerra. Some abilities these monks have in addition to the generic lunar monk abilities are:
* Healing the sick and wounded
* Increased Stamina and resilience
* Increased agility and mobility
The Invigorative Lunar Monks are the primary healers and physicians of the community healing any and all who are sick or injured. As well they are sometimes called upon for tasks that require more stamina, endurance, or agility than the typical human would possess.
 
### Destructive Lunar Monks
This sect of Lunar Monk primarily focuses on channeling the power of the Vibrant Moon to empower their strength and power. Their powers are of course more potent when the Vibrant moon is closer to MagusTerr. Some abilities these monks have in addition to the generic lunar monk abilities are:
* Increased Physical Strength
* Improved Telekinesis
* Ability to Implode moderately sized objects and structures.
The Destructive monks primarily focus on the study and preservation of the practice. There isn't much need for them to use their destructive powers seeing as the village is rarely under any form of attack, but the practice must be preserved in case it is ever needed for the destructive Lunar Monks are the primary defensive force of the village.
