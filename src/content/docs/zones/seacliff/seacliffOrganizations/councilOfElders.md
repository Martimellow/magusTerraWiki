This is the governing body of [SeaCliff](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seacliff/). It is comprised of the most skilled elders in the village, who are generally the most wise. Their primary duties are to oversee the training of new individuals in their respective crafts, however when there are disputes among the villagers the council is called together to make the final decision.

# Structure
There is no singular leader of the Council of Elders rather all members are respected as equals. That being said each elder is given a vote based on the number of skills they have mastered. Most have only mastered one skill, however, some have managed to master two giving them more pull in the voting as a result of their better understanding of the multiple components that go into keeping the village alive, and a show of reverence for their extra dedication to supporting the village through their extra skill. However, this is not necessarily an envious position, becoming a Grand Master of two critical skills puts a lot of responsibility and work on the individual.

# Public Agenda
The council's primary goal is to ensure the survival of the community and therefore as many individuals as possible.

# Assets
The Council of Elder's primary asset is respect. They have gained the communities respect through a lifetime of service and experience. Naturally, they are considered the wisest and most dedicated individuals who will have the best chance at keeping the community alive.
