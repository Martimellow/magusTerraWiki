The village of [SeaCliff](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seacliff/) is located on a coastal cliff side in a frosty wasteland. The villagers settled here because of a single hot spring at the top of the cliff that provides some much-needed warmth to the area. The town turned this hot spring into a Communal Bath House. It would be too complicated to provide plumbing to each individual dwelling and the water would cool off too much by that time.
 
An interesting note about the bathhouse is that the bathing pool is unisex. The community only developed a single room for bathing because that is where the hot spring was located. This can result in some sexual arousal as there is a mixture of sexes naked and in the water at the same time. But that being said the importance of the heating waters of the bathhouse is held at an almost sacred level, as well due to the mutual dependence of everyone in the community on each other the members of the community have developed a deep respect for each other and refrain from sexual activity in the bathhouse. Minor forms of PDA are allowed such as hugging and kissing, but any further sexual activity is cracked down on swiftly.

# Purpose / Function
This bathhouse allows for all the users of [SeaCliff](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seacliff/) to bathe themselves with warm water.

# Architecture
The architecture is very simple as are most things in [SeaCliff](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seacliff/) . The exterior is a long but simple rectangular wooden frame. The doors are reinforced with extra planks of wood to ensure the gusty winds don't blow them open or break them down. There are rolled furs at the base of the doors to prevent extra warmth from escaping through the cracks in the doors.
 
Something that is slightly different from most of the other buildings in SeaCliff is that there are multiple rooms between the main entrance and the bathing waters to keep the warmth of the bathing waters in. First, there is the main entrance and walkway. This door opens directly to the outside and is the coldest room. Then there is the locker room where there are shelves put in place for the villagers to neatly place their clothing. Finally, there is the actual bathing room where there is a long heated pool of natural spring water that everyone bathes in.
