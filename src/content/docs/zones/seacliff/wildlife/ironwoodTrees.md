Incredibly durable evergreen trees that took hold in the harsh frozen climate of the land South of [SeaCliff](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seacliff/) .

# Basic Information
## Anatomy
In order to reproduce in the permanently frozen landscape surrounding [SeaCliff](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seacliff/)  the IronWood trees absorb heat from the water of the hot springs flowing deep below the frozen ground and store this heat in a salve contained within their pinecones. When the pine cones fall and disperse their seeds, the seed's salve thaws the snow and frozen ground allowing the seeds to take root and giving them a water source. As well the IronWoods trees are, well, strong as iron, meaning their roots can burrow deep into the frozen ground, even early on, until they get to the thawed soil beneath and the warmer groundwater.

## Ecology and Habitats
The IronWood Trees grow in the harsh frozen lands south of [SeaCliff](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/seacliff/) .

# Additional Information
## Uses, Products & Exploitation
IronWood trees are used by the extremely skilled [Clifton](/magusTerraWiki/zones/seacliff/residents/cliftons/)  carpenters to make extra durable houses, barrels, ships, and other wooden goods. The IronWoods are especially useful for ships as the Cliftons often need to break through patches of ice, the reinforced wood allows them to do this without sustaining significant damage. As well the barrels and others goods are highly sought after by the Northerners of MagusTerra due to their legendary durability, but Cliftons often don't like interacting with mainlanders as they see very little need to.
