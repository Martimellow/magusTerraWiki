# Points of Interest
## The Wall 
The devastation from the [Dereliction of Terrkanei](/magusTerraWiki/zones/volariso/dereliction/) came unnervingly close to the **Imboivar Sea** leaving a relatively thin wall of land preventing the sea from coming crashing in to the crater. Such an event would be unimaginable, absolute devastation, villages swept away, thousands drowned and with the crater being as large as it is the global sea level would drop, admittedly it wouldn't be too drastic of a drop but certain ecosystems such as the archipelagos, swamps, tidal pools and undersea establishments could be significantly effected. 
In the interest of preserving their own ecosystems an alliance of Bezmertan, Merfolk, Naga and Mages has been formed to protect this wall from fiends attempting to sow chaos into the world.   



# Factions
## Sentinels of Terrkanei
After the [Dereliction of Terrkanei](/magusTerraWiki/zones/volariso/dereliction/) the top remaining mages of [Terrkanei](/magusTerraWiki/worldtrees/terrkanei) unanimously decided that strict protections were needed to ensure the safety of Terrkanei, the arcane, and Magusterra as a whole. If Terrkanei was destroyed by some other freak accident the repercussions were incalculable. Thus they developed the Sentinels of Terrkanei, an elite group of battle mages vehemently devoted to protecting Terrkanei. They were initially stationed immediately around Terrkanei but as they had time to expand their ranks they were able to deploy Sentinels down into the Crater, and soon they were a fully occupying force.  

### Equipment 
The Sentinels are equipped with extravagant plate suits of armor engraved with scripty runes and enchanted for extra magical protection, they don't wear helmets but they carry full body sized "Spellbook Shields" which have notes of their choosing engraved in glowing ruins on the inside of the shield, functioning as a dual purposed shield and spellbook, and their other hand is left free for spell casting. 

### Public Opinion
Immediately after the [Dereliction of Terrkanei](/magusTerraWiki/zones/volariso/dereliction/) there was wide spread support for these guardians, many civilians were lost in the explosion and the world felt as if it would never recover. As the force became more established they were able to expand their influence until they had Sentinels stationed and patrolling all throughout [Terrkanei](/magusTerraWiki/worldtrees/terrkanei) and the Crater of Volariso. The Sentinels were comforting though standoffish as their sole focus was protecting Terrkanei, not so much the inhabitants around. As time passed people went from grateful and comforted to accustomed and indifferent. However after centuries of perceived peace and slowly growing corruption the Sentries have become more power hungry, forceful and unnecessary. The people of Volariso are becoming fed up with the Sentinels dogmatic and unapproachable nature; animosity is growing with protest and slogans against the Sentinels so much so that colloquially they are becoming known as "Tin Constructs" in reference to their inhospitality.
