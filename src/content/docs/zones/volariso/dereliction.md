title: The Dereliction of Terrkanei
---
The fateful day that rendered Terrkanei the lone mountain peak of Volariso. 

# The Tale
The mountains that make up the Floating Islands were once part of a mountain range connected to [Terrkanei](/magusTerraWiki/worldtrees/terrkanei). At the time the entire mountain range was imbued with ley energy thanks to Terrkanei's powerful roots. It drew in peoples from all over MagusTerra, mana users, inventors, traders etc. A group of inventors wanted to better understand the ley energy so they could harness it for their creations. They hired a group of dwarves to mine the magic infused earth and gather samples to be studied. One fateful day the dwarves struck a powerful ley line running through the rock, they had come across many ley lines in the past with no issue, but this one must have been one of the major lines in the area, the entire mountain range exploded in an world shaking event throwing mountains in the air, killing thousands and leaving behind a giant crater that came to be known as the [Crater of Volariso](/magusTerraWiki/zones/volariso/crater/). Months later as the sediment finally settled it could be seen that the mountain range that once spanned Volariso had not been obliterated but rather thrown into the air, upturned and settled into some kind of equilibrium floating in the sky above the cater.

# The Fallout 
## Dwarves 
The dwarves as a people were somewhat unfairly blamed as a whole for the dereliction, it was only a small group of dwarves involved and they were hired by inventors to do the mining. But the story that was told was that greedy dwarves dug to deep and to carelessly and now the entirety of Volariso is in shambles. Many loved ones were lost in the the dereliction and thus people cared not for the details of the exact event and anti dwarf sentiments were strong. The dwarfs sought refuge in exile by moving their capital city to the Fjords in the far north of Magusterra and swearing off mining as whole. 

Not only did the populous of Magusterra lose trust in the Dwarvish people but so too did the dwarvish people lose trust in magic. Dwarves were also victims of the dereliction, many of their kind were living in Volariso when the explosion happened. And further more if it wasn't for the wretched ley energy their people would not have been shunned by the world. As a result the dwarvish people tend to distrust magic users and though they exist you will be hard pressed to find mages amongst the dwarves.
