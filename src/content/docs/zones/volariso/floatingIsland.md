title: Floating Islands of Volariso
---
The floating islands of Volariso are large mountains turned upside down, imbued with ley energy floating above the [Crater of Volariso](/magusTerraWiki/zones/volariso/crater/). They were not a natural formation in Magusterra but rather came to be after a devastating magical explosion that blew the land masses into the sky. 

# Origin
The mountains that make up the Floating Islands were once part of a mountain range connected to [Terrkanei](/magusTerraWiki/worldtrees/terrkanei). At the time the entire mountain range was imbued with ley energy thanks to Terrkanei's powerful roots. It drew in peoples from all over MagusTerra, mana users, inventors, traders etc. A group of inventors wanted to better understand the ley energy so they could harness it for their creations. They hired a group of dwarves to mine the magic infused earth and gather samples to be studied. One fateful day the dwarves struck a powerful ley line running through the rock, they had come across many ley lines in the past with no issue, but this one must have been one of the major lines in the area, the entire mountain range exploded in an world shaking event throwing mountains in the air, killing thousands and leaving behind a giant crater that came to be known as the [Crater of Volariso](/magusTerraWiki/zones/volariso/crater/). Months later as the sediment finally settled it could be seen that the mountain range that once spanned Volariso had not been obliterated but rather thrown into the air, upturned and settled into some kind of equilibrium floating in the sky above the cater.
