## Personal history
James was the Lord of [Maeloch](/magusTerraWiki/zones/southlands/maeloch/) for several years until he stepped down and gave the thrown to Lord Depic because he felt he had fulfilled his service and no longer wished to deal with the stresses of running the lands. He and his wife moved to a small cabin, that he build himself, in the forest near The Ishcular Channel to live out the rest of their lives peacefully with nature.
