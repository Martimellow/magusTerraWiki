title: The Banshee Badlands
---
The Banshee Badlands is home to [Taegar the Animator](/magusTerraWiki/zones/southlands/bansheebadlands/taegartheanimator/), a powerful necromancer, and his son. Taegar has filled The Banshee Badlands with wraiths, banshees, rusalki, undead animals, zombies, skeletons, and ghouls that he controls to keep people out of the wasteland that spans from **Astraloth** to **Anglers Port** to **Hollowford**, with hopes of protecting his son.
