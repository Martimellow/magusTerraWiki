## Purpose / Function
These days The Forsaken Wharf is used as a hideout of the Pirates of **Smuggler's Cove** and a resupply point for [Taegar the Animator](/magusTerraWiki/zones/southlands/bansheebadlands/taegartheanimator/).

## Valuables
The Pirates are careful not to leave too much treasure here as they don't fully trust [Taegar](/magusTerraWiki/zones/southlands/bansheebadlands/taegartheanimator/) and realize he could easily overpower them with his army of undead. However, with it being such a nice resting point on the opposite side of The Southlands from **Smuggler's Cove** some treasure is left there either for resupply on longer raids or simply because it can be a logistical challenge moving so much booty through the bone-chilling seas.

## Hazards & Traps
The Forsaken Wharf is deep within [The Banshee Badlands](/magusTerraWiki/zones/southlands/bansheebadlands/thebansheebadlands/) which is full of all manner of undead creatures that keep any threats at bay or most decidedly neutralized.
 
If any treasure hunters were to somehow get past all the ghosts and ghouls the pirates have laid their own trap doors, steep drops, and dangerous booby traps to protect the plunder they store there from time to time.

## History
The Forsaken Wharf was once a moderately popular port used by travelers and traders on their way around the southern tip of MagusTerra and The Southlands. However, as days went on this port fell into obscurity and after being abandoned for years ghost stories were told about the Old Haunted Wharf. Eventually [Taegar the Animator](/magusTerraWiki/zones/southlands/bansheebadlands/taegartheanimator/) ran off to the Wharf to hide away with his son. He started to summon undead spirits and creatures in the area turning the ghost stories into true accounts ensuring the townsfolk would never venture anywhere near the area. 
 
After many years of the Forsaken Wharf being truly haunted, Taegar made a tenuous alliance with the Pirates of Smuggler's Cove allowing them to hide out there in exchange for supplies and no questions asked. Present day the pirates often set up camp at the Wharf after long days of travel and raiding the frigid southern waters.
