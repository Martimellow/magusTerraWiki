title: Hand of Den Gru'le
---
The Hand of Den Gru'le is a warlock cult hidden in a mountain range in The Southlands. 

# Structure
There is only a loose organizational structure in this organization because it is purely based on control. You outrank someone if you are able to consistently impose your will upon them. Sometimes this is done through psychological manipulation, sometimes physical, and sometimes even magical manipulation.
 
New members are recruited into the organization by the weaker members of the organization so that they have somebody easy for them to control due to their inexperience. However, as those new recruits start to gain experience they will inevitably start vying for control over other members. This keeps more senior members on their toes because if they become complacent they could fall prey to the younger recruits.
 
This cyclical nature is incredibly toxic of course, however, it does a remarkably good job of advancing the dark magic and manipulation tactics of the warlock clan as a whole. All according to the plan of the **Arch Warlock Den Gru'le** himself.

# Culture
## Internal
Internally the organization is incredibly toxic. It advances its knowledge through the vicious cycle of inviting recruits to be manipulated by the current members. Then the recruits either invite further new recruits or learn to manipulate their masters. Thus pushing the masters to learn new ways of control or recruiting new less wise recruits. And so on and so forth. There are no friends within the organization, occasionally alliances but ones that one can never be too sure of.
 
## External
Externally the organization is not well known. They routinely engage in vile acts of kidnapping, torture, and sacrifice so they keep a low profile by hiding in a secret cave. Those who do catch wind of the clan are usually in direct contact with members trying to enlist them into the ranks with the promise of power over lesser-minded beings and the allure of exclusive knowledge that only the Hand of Den Gru'le has and is willing to give out.
 
As well there is a village near the forest where the clan's hideout is located. This village is unaware of the clan itself but due to the disappearances, they are extremely afraid of the forest itself and have made up all sorts of myths and legends about the evil magic that lurks within that forest.

# Trade & Transport
The clan does minimal trading and battering seeing as they typically steal, coerce, or kill others to get the supplies they want or need. Occasionally during travel and far away from their main sphere of influence, they will be more inclined to trade and act normally to maintain a low profile/some level of diplomacy.

# Infrastructure
The clan resides in a reasonably sized underground base whose main entrance is through a cave hidden deep within a dense forest. The cave facility has been developed with proper brick walls doors and other furnishings to make it a true area of operation, not just a dank cave. However, the main entrance is still just a cave.
