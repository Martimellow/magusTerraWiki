# Personality Characteristics
## Motivation
He like most other warlocks is seeking control over others. He isn't skilled enough to do that with experience warlocks so he constantly hunts for new recruits.

## Savvies & Inaptitudes
Dredge has been with the [Hand of Den Gru'le](/magusTerraWiki/zones/southlands/cavernsofdengrule/handofdengrule/) for a while however he has never been particularly skilled with the manipulation tactics that are so crucial to the social structure of the organization. So he has fallen into the habit of seeking out new recruits more frequently than most, as his previous recruits learn even stronger manipulation tactics and move past him. He has gone so far as to start calling himself the lead recruiter for the clan.
 
The more skilled warlocks don't worry too much about him because they feel no threat from him, and the constant influx of new members gives them plenty of young acolytes to test with. And if things go a little wrong and fatalities occur they need not concern themselves too much.

## Virtues & Personality perks
One perk of his constant recruiting is that Dredge often ventures off to distant lands to find shady individuals that he can bring into the clan.
