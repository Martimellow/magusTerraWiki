# Physical Description
## Apparel & Accessories
The Arch Warlock wears oversized murky purple robes to disguise his sickly stature and traumatic disfigurements. He hides any semblance of the humanity he once possessed underneath his all-enveloping hood, the only facial features that can be made out are his radiating Fel green eyes which let off a faint glow as the excessive demonic energy pours out of his body. Unlike most warlocks, whose Fel energy only escapes their body from their eyes, the body’s most vulnerable point, the Arch Warlock's ancient chronic use of the toxic magic has tainted his body so severely that the faint green glow tattoos his entire body seeps through his otherwise shadowy apparel.
