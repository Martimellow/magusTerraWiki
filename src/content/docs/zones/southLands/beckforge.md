Beckforge Resides within the rolling hills known as the Echoing Hills, in fact, the settlement is the reason the hills have their name. The smithing and mining that goes on atop the large hill and within the other smaller settlements within the hills can be heard ringing and echoing throughout the hills constantly, giving them their iconic name.

# Industry & Trade
The Dwarves of BeckForge primarily trade with the Capital city of [Maeloch](/magusTerraWiki/zones/southlands/maeloch/) as well as the small hub Astraloth which is on the way to the Capital City. Their main goods are of course the strong weapons, armor, and other metalworks they smith. As well as the jewelry they craft, though, the Echoing Hills don't have terribly rich gem deposits so the dwarves mainly focus on the metals.

# Infrastructure
BeckForge isn't like the conventional dwarven city hidden deep within the roots of a mountain, rather it sits proudly atop one of the largest hills in The Echoing Hills. That being said the dwarves that live there still specialize in mining and blacksmithing the iron and other sturdy metals found beneath the earth in the Echoing Hills. They use this metal for all the conventional uses one might think of as well as building an unyielding metal rampart around their city to protect against wildlife and potential invasion. This metal ring around the city can be seen from miles away and is reverently referred to as The Crown of the Echoing Hills.

# Climate
Due to BeckForge's southern location, it is often quite cold there. The stalwart iron wall surrounding the city does help to reduce the wind sweeping through but it doesn't stop the snow in the winter months. It would normally be quite cold in the metal buildings if it weren't for all the nearby raging forges keeping the temperature of the city significantly warmer than the surrounding lands.
