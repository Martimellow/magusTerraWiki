The Silvermoon Trackers is a multi-species organization found in Howling Timber who's main goal is to eradicate the plight of feral [Vehkran](/magusTerraWiki/races/vehkran) by researching [Sangvehk](/magusTerraWiki/races/sangvehk), propagating [Vehkmoss](/magusTerraWiki/zones/howlingtimber/vehkmoss), cultivating remedies, hunting down Vehkran and curing them. 

## Technological Level
The Silvermoon Trackers conduct several avenues of research in their pursuit of curing feral [Vehkran](/magusTerraWiki/races/vehkran).

## Herbalism
The trackers need abundant supplies of [Vehkmoss](/magusTerraWiki/zones/howlingtimber/vehkmoss) to be able to make potions that can not only manage their own [Sangvehk](/magusTerraWiki/races/sangvehk) levels but also be used on the feral [vehkran](/magusTerraWiki/races/vehkran). They are always studying their growing techniques and the nature of the herb to ensure that they can grow as much as possible and keep their sangvehk combating ability as potent as possible.
 
## Alchemy
Not only do the trackers need to grow the herb but they need to be able to brew it into potent potions to reduce the [Sangvehk](/magusTerraWiki/races/sangvehk)  levels as much as possible. The Apothecaries Academy is dedicated to not only teaching new [Vehkran](/magusTerraWiki/races/vehkran) the ways of brewing these potions but also researching new ways to make the potions as potent as possible. The stronger the potions are the more feral Vehkran they can save with a given supply of [Vehkmoss](/magusTerraWiki/zones/howlingtimber/vehkmoss).
 
## Astronomy
One crucial breakthrough discovered by Esther Lunam was that the potency of [Vehkmoss](/magusTerraWiki/zones/howlingtimber/vehkmoss) and the potions brewed from it are increased during an Enlarged [Dull Moon](/magusTerraWiki/cosmos/dullmoon/). Vehkmoss is largely harvested during this time and then large batches are brewed to lock int he potency of the concoction. Esther also discovered that the feral [Vehkran](/magusTerraWiki/races/vehkran) are spurred on to become more aggressive during an Enlarged [Vibrant Moon](/magusTerraWiki/cosmos/vibrantmoon). these discoveries made it clear to the Silvermoon Trackers that a clear understanding and tracking of the intertwined lunar cycles was immensely important and thus Esther's Observatory was created atop a cliff near Vehkrest.
