title: Vehkmoss
---

A mossy herb with small brown flowers on it that grow ever so faintly. This moss is used by the [Vehkran](/races/vehkran) to keep their levels of [Sangvehk](/races/sangvehk) in check. Vehkmoss draws on energy from the [Dull Moon](/cosmos/dullmoon) so when the Dull moon is enlarged the vehkmoss glows more vibrantly, grows quicker and has a greater effect on sangvehk.
